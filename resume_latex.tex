\section*{Relevant Work Experience and Personal Projects}

\textbf{Data Science Intern} \\
\textit{Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute} \hfill 2023
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
    \item Developed machine learning models to identify snow depth and coverage in camera trap images.
    \item Utilized Keras/TensorFlow and scikit-learn to implement semantic segmentation models using U-net, linear models using neural networks (NN) and regressions, and classification models using transfer learning and random forests.
    \item Optimized image processing using NumPy and Pillow, and minimized RAM and VRAM usage during model training.
    \item Created algorithms for object contouring, object detection, and outlier detection. Employed Pandas to manage, edit, and read large datasets.
    \item Presented results to a biology and ecology panel, communicating technical machine learning concepts to a non-technical audience.
    \item Achieved 84\% accuracy in identifying snow measuring sticks and 96\% accuracy in classifying snow coverage.
    \item Currently working towards publication and production via command line on a server.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Personal Project: NFL Score Prediction Model} \hfill 2023
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
    \item Used BeautifulSoup for web scraping sports stats websites to gather data.
    \item Developed a predictive model for NFL game outcomes using a compiled dataset.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Personal Project: Stock Market Dataset} \hfill 2022
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
    \item Used yfinance to compile live datasets in Excel for use in machine learning models.
\end{itemize}
